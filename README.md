# Machine-Learning-Basics
This is basic programs for machine learning fundemantals.
according to my understanding 
we have to get random 1000 inputs for Θ⁰, Θ¹ 

We have to plot Θ⁰ vs Θ¹  Graph  
then we have to plot J(Θ⁰, Θ¹ ) vs Θ⁰ vs  Θ¹   graph
the minimum of j(Θ⁰, Θ¹ ) will be the best fitting model

we have to find that

where 
Θ⁰, Θ¹ : parameters of f(x)=Θ⁰+Θ¹x
j(Θ⁰, Θ¹ ) : squared error cost function
